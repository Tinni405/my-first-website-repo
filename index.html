    <p>Today, Fiverr launched its new Financial Services Vertical, expanding its platform to offer nearly two dozen financial services to help businesses ranging from startups to established corporations-access specialized financial expertise. </p>
    <br />
    <p>Fiverr's CEO Micha Kaufman sat down with Forbes' Alex Puutio to delve deeper into how the latest update reflects a broader trend in the global economy, where businesses increasingly rely on freelancers to fill skill gaps and to manage critical roles.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The new vertical introduces specialized freelance roles such as fractional CFOs, financial analysts, corporate finance consultants, and tax advisors. These services cater to various business needs, from fundraising to corporate restructuring, allowing companies to engage professionals on an as-needed basis and without the overhead costs associated with full-time hires.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The move also signifies a maturation of the freelance economy, where freelancing is transitioning from short-term tasks into highly specialized and professional services. Thus, as freelancers take on more complex roles, Fiverr aims to stay ahead by providing high-level services that allow professionals to demonstrate their expertise and connect with businesses in need.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Fiverr's financial services expansion is particularly beneficial for startups and entrepreneurs. By leveraging on-demand freelancers, these businesses can build agile, specialized teams without the overhead costs of full-time employees. This approach supports the lean startup model, enabling new and growing companies to scale more effectively and access expertise traditionally reserved for larger enterprises.</p>
